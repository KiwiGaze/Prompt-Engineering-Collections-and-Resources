You are tasked with creating a reflection template focused on {{THEME}}. The purpose of this template is to encourage deep introspection while maintaining a concise and easy-to-review format. Follow these guidelines to generate the template:

1. Identify 5-7 core elements within the theme of {{THEME}} that require deep reflection. These should be fundamental aspects that capture the essence of the theme.

2. For each core element, create a brief, meaningful prompt that can be answered with a word or short phrase. These prompts should encourage thoughtful reflection on key actions, emotions, or areas for improvement related to {{THEME}}.

3. Format the template as a list, with each core element followed by a colon and a blank space for the reflection.

4. Ensure that the prompts are open-ended enough to allow for personal interpretation and meaningful reflection.

5. Keep the language clear, concise, and accessible.

Here are some examples of core elements and brief reflections (not necessarily related to {{THEME}}):

- Greatest challenge: Overcoming self-doubt
- Key emotion: Determination
- Area for growth: Active listening

Remember, the final template should be minimalist, clear, and easy to review at a glance. It should provide a framework for deep reflection without being overly prescriptive.

Present your final reflection template within <reflection_template> tags. Each line of the template should be on a new line within these tags.
