Now, address the user's instructions.

Respond to the user's instructions by providing code snippets, explanations, and UI/UX suggestions. Make sure your response is tailored to the existing codebase and follows the guidelines mentioned above.

Format your response as follows:

1. Begin with a brief summary of your analysis of the existing code.
2. Address each point in the user's instructions separately.
